# Flowflare Examples

This directory contains example workflow implementations to demonstrate how to use Flowflare.

## Files

- `dns-workflow.js` - Example workflow for DNS zone registration and configuration
- `order-workflow.js` - Example workflow for order processing

These examples show how to:

1. Track workflow execution with steps
2. Handle errors and retries
3. Manage workflow state
4. Use reference IDs and types
5. Store input/output as JSON

You can use these examples as templates for your own workflow implementations.
